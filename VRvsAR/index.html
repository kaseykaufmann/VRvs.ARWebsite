            <h2><b>What Is Virtual Reality?</b></h2>
            <div>
                <p>
                    Virtual reality is a "full dive" experience that replaces your surroundings with a virtual
                    environment. Most VR gear
                    is non-transparent headsets that use six-degrees-of-freedom (6DOF) motion tracking made possible by
                    external sensors. These detect any movement in the body; however that mobility is limited by a few
                    square meters of space, and does not counteract the possibilities of bumping into objects within
                    your
                    real surroundings. Some headsets only function on three-degrees-of-freedom where only the movement
                    and direction of the head is considered.
                </p>

            <h2><b>How Does Healthcare Evolve?</b></h2>
            <div>
                <p>
                    The use of VR technology allows the opportunity for medical students and professionals to practice
                    their craft, more specifically within surgical and life-threatening situations that can not be
                    recreated in practice for obvious reasons. Virtual headsets could also simulate a meeting room for
                    both patients and medical interviews, for instances where individuals would not have access to see
                    each
                    other in person. Future applications for this field also include general examinations and therapy
                    sessions at the comfort of one’s home.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h2><b>Virtual Reality Marketing</b></h2>
            <div>
                <p>
                    A 360-degree virtual reproduction of any desired location is a great way of enticing curious
                    travelers who may have doubts towards buying their tickets. Museums such as the Louvre already
                    offer virtual
                    tours which showcase some of their artworks and installations. With VR, online marketing companies
                    could provide a better look within products viewed by customers, and it is notably useful for
                    real-estate and tourist attractions that rely on visuals as well as their use of space.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h2><b>Virtual Reality And Education</b></h2>
            <div>
                <p>
                    From schools, universities, to training stations, virtual reality has slowly mounted its way to
                    becoming a notable part of education. As mentioned, students have the ability to immerse themselves
                    in virtual locations and situations, that would otherwise be unattainable in real life. VR displays
                    detailed and interactive simulations that challenges most 2-D illustrations, ranging from human
                    anatomy, the locations of stars within a galaxy, and almost any kind of data that could be
                    visualized in three dimensions.

            <h2>What Is Augmented Reality?</h2>
                <p>
                    Augmented reality adds to our surroundings rather than completely replacing it. Most AR applications
                    can easily function on 6DOF by tracking the user’s phone location. AR headsets, which are transparent
                    in comparison, use camera or laser sensors. AR could definitely enhance one’s experiences with more
                    mobility but does not offer as much immersion as VR.

            <h2><b>What Are The Applications In Gaming For Augmented Reality?</b></h2>
            <div>
                <p>
                    While also applicable to VR, augmented reality has made far better strides in gaming consoles and
                    applications, with Pokemon Go being the prime example of its success and popularity. With mobile
                    devices as its main platform, AR within gaming is extremely accessible and relies on the concept of
                    having virtual objects or characters become a part of real-world surroundings, which in turn makes
                    them believable and concrete within a screen.

            <h2><b>Augmented Reality In Retail</b></h2>
            <div>
                <p>
                    The increasing popularity and reliance on online shopping has led developers to think of new and
                    innovative ways to have their products be tested through the digital lens. AR’s distinctive quality
                    of allowing real surroundings to be seen can be essential for furniture stores that can show how any
                    product would look within a given room. The same concept goes for clothing which could be “worn” by
                    users through the touch of a button.

            <h2><b>How AR Will Help In Navigation And Utilities</b></h2>
            <div>
                <p>
                    Among one of the developing fields in augmented reality is navigation. The brand Google Glass has
                    spurred interest in wearable AR, with the promise of allowing users to move around and see the real
                    world while witnessing icons that could help them in navigating direction or even searching
                    information without having to look down on their phone. The utility of this kind of AR is comparable to smart
                    watches that eliminate the use of a mobile device for quick and simple actions.

            <div>
                <p>
                    Technology for virtual and augmented reality share the same fundamental mechanics when it comes to
                    track the movements of any given device as well as the programming that goes into the tracking and
                    development of realistic virtual objects within a digital screen.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Applications also coincide within augmented and virtual reality as companies take advantage of
                    demand, modifying the any service based on the limitations and positive characteristics of either
                    side to produce a similar output for each given experience. Although one field may work better with
                    AR or vice versa, applications in communication, entertainment, and marketing are all obtainable in
                    both technologies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Both have applications to science and medicine. Notwithstanding some variations, both AR and VR
                    have also received similar ratings and criticism when it comes to their use within the entertainment
                    world. These technologies are receive repeated approvals when it comes to being the main platform
                    for various games and media that would otherwise not have the same accolade without the immersive
                    experience that augmented and virtual reality provide. Critics, on the other hand, argue that
                    prolonged used of these products leads to added issues regarding eyesight deterioration and video
                    game addiction.

            <h2><b>Differences Between Virtual And Augmented Reality</b></h2>
            <div>
                <p>
                    Relatively speaking, VR is utilized to a higher extent in both standalone and PC-connected
                    headsets.
                </p>
                <p>
                    PC headsets can provide the highest quality in both digital images and interaction as they are
                    linked to a much faster processor. The drawback to these products is the lack of mobility and
                    maneuverability within simulations, as well as the added risk of tangling or disconnecting the
                    wires that connect these headsets to immobile machines.These devices are best suited for programs
                    that simulate user within a sitting-down position or in cases where minimal movement is required.
                    Great examples of PC headsets are the HTC Vive, Oculus Rift, and PlayStation VR.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Standalone headsets, on the other hand, provide much more flexibility in movement as they carry
                    small and lightweight processors integrated within the devices. These headsets are more accessible
                    to the public and can be connected to smartphones and small devices, however it is important to
                    always take note of one’s surrounding as these headsets may or may not provide any indications of
                    bumping into physical obstacles in the real surroundings. Products like the Samsung Gear VR are
                    cheap, readily available, and can even be bundled with purchases of certain mobile devices.
